abstract = {Aging is characterized by a decline in tissue function, but the underlying changes at cellular resolution across the organism remain unclear. Here, we present the Aging Fly Cell Atlas, a single-nucleus transcriptomic map of the whole aging Drosophila. We characterized 163 distinct cell types and performed an in-depth analysis of changes in tissue cell composition, gene expression, and cell identities. We further developed aging clock models to predict fly age and show that ribosomal gene expression is a conserved predictive factor for age. Combining all aging features, we find distinctive cell type–specific aging patterns. This atlas provides a valuable resource for studying fundamental principles of aging in complex organisms. Aging is a fundamental process in multicellular life, and many phenotypes associated with aging are conserved across mammals and beyond. However, characterizing cellular processes across tissues over the life of an organism has been historically difficult to achieve. Lu et al. performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing at multiple time points across the life span of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. After examining more than 850,000 nuclei across 163 cell types, the authors identified changes in gene expression and cellular composition during the aging process and used them to develop an aging clock. This atlas will serve as a resource for studying the process of aging in this important model organism. —Corinne Simonti The Aging Fly Cell Atlas reveals the transcriptional changes across tissues over the lifetime of a hallmark model organism, Drosophila melanogaster.}}
