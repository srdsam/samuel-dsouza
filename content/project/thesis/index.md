title: Classifying the orientation of the heart in a series of MRI scan
summary: This paper presents the development of a machine learning algorithm that accurately classifies the 'view' of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) images, achieving near human expert-level performance with the EfficientNet-B5 architecture, potentially forming the basis for future AI solutions in cardiac diagnosis.
