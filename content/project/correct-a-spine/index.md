title: Correct-a-spine
summary: Problems with posture arise because of upper and lower back problems, but the current technologies only focus on one of these, and so we decided to use an accelerometer and flex sensor to measure both of these to prevent both kinds of back pain with a single device. The results are shows in an iOS application which is sent the data via Bluetooth.
