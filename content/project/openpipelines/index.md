title: OpenPipelines
summary: OpenPipelines are best-practice workflows for single-cell single- and multi-omics data. To ensure these workflows are accessible to non-experts and can be deployed in a fast and reproducible way, we will build these into reproducible, modular, and updatable best-practice analysis pipelines using industry-standard workflow tools, high-performance versions of popular methods, and an interoperable, language-independent framework.
