I am a research software engineer with expertise across bioinformatics, software engineering, and machine learning. I hold a BSc in Medical Biosciences from Imperial College London and have further completed numerous online courses in various relevant fields. I thrive in collaborative and supportive environments that promote creative, thorough engineering, enabling engineers like myself to address challenging issues with innovative solutions.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in research and development, focusing on bioinformatics and software engineering in organizations such as illumina, Leonyte Biosystems, and Automat. As a Lead Data Engineer at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, I spearheaded the development of the Datahub project, aimed at structuring data for research purposes. I also worked closely with the data science platform to analyze and interpret transcriptomics and spatial datasets through graph theory.

My technical skillset encompasses programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, Nextflow, Java, Arduino, and Rust, as well as web development technologies including ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, and HTML. I am proficient in databases like Neo4J, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and JSON, and have experience with DevOps tools such as Docker, Singularity, AWS, Serverless, Git, and HPC (on-premise deployments). Moreover, I have hands-on experience with lab techniques like CRISPR, western blot, qPCR, cell culture, genotyping, and phenotyping.

Outside the professional realm, I actively participate in Muay Thai and open water swimming with the South End Rowing Club. I have held leadership positions in sports organizations, including serving as Treasurer for Imperial College Swim and Waterpolo (ICSWP) and playing in the BUCS Premier League Waterpolo for Imperial College London.
